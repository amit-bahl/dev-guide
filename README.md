This repository has a list of cookbooks & tutorials for standard deployment configurations as we use at HashedIn. Our goal is to create these as recipes rather than cookbook. So that like a recipe, it can be modified to one's tastes.

For each of these cookbooks, we intend to ensure the following features

##Features

1. Development Setup
1. Linting & Code Conventions
1. Testing & Code Coverage
1. Logging & Monitoring
1. Production Deployment & Infrastructure Setup
